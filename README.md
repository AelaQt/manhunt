# manhunt

a datapack for minecraft manhunt, supports any amount of runners / hunters
hunters have a compass that updates when held in main hand / offhand
the compass will point to the nearest runner, it could be weird if runners are in different dimensions but it should point to a portal if no runners are in the same dimension
once runners die the compass should no longer point towards them
players are hunters by default
when runners die they can spectate
recommend making a script that resets the world on server start
also recommend having a whitelist server, if random people join they can become hunters
adding more runners mid game should not be done and is disabled

you can switch roles with
/trigger role

you can start game with
/trigger start
